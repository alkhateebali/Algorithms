# Linear Search Algorithm

## Overview

- Linear Search, also known as Sequential Search, is a straightforward algorithm for finding the position of a target
  element in an array.
- It iterates through each element in the array until it finds the target or reaches the end.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Start at the Beginning:** Begin searching from the first element of the array.
2. **Iterate Through Array:** Move through each element one by one until the target element is found or the end of the
   array is reached.
3. **Target Found:** If the target element is found, return its index.
4. **Target Not Found:** If the entire array is searched, return a special value (e.g., -1) to indicate that the target
   is not present.

## Key Characteristics

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Suitable for small datasets.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- Straightforward implementation.
- Works well for small datasets.

### Disadvantages

- Inefficient for large datasets compared to more advanced search algorithms.
- Iterates through the entire array, even if the target is found early.

## Use Cases

- Suitable for small datasets or scenarios where the dataset is not sorted.
- Commonly used when a simple search algorithm is sufficient.

## Example

Consider an array: `[5, 3, 9, 2, 7]` and a target element `2`.

1. Start at the beginning.
2. Iterate through the array: `5` (no match), `3` (no match), `9` (no match), `2` (match found at index 3).
3. Return the index `3` as the result.

## Conclusion

Linear Search is a simple algorithm that sequentially searches through each element in the array until it finds the
target or reaches the end.

# Binary Search Algorithm

## Overview

- Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target element in a sorted array.
- It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- The target element is compared with the middle element of the array, narrowing down the search range.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Sort the Array:** Binary Search requires a sorted array as input.
2. **Initialize Search Interval:** Set the search interval as the entire array.
3. **Find the Middle:** Compute the middle index of the search interval.
4. **Compare and Narrow Down:** Compare the target element with the middle element.
    - If equal, return the middle index as the result.
    - If less, search in the left half of the array.
    - If greater, search in the right half of the array.
5. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 3-4 until the target is found or the search interval becomes empty.

## Key Characteristics

- Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- Requires a sorted array as input.
- Efficient for large datasets.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- Significantly faster than Linear Search for large datasets.
- Logarithmic time complexity.

### Disadvantages

- Requires a sorted array as input.
- Additional space is not minimized.

## Use Cases

- Efficient for searching in large sorted datasets.
- Well-suited for scenarios where the dataset is static or changes infrequently.

## Example

Consider a sorted array: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` and a target element `6`.

1. Start with the entire array as the search interval.
2. Find the middle: `6` (equal to the target).
3. Return the index of `6` as the result.

## Conclusion

Binary Search efficiently finds a target element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

# Ternary Search Algorithm

### Overview

Ternary Search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used to find the position of a specific value within a sorted array. It
is an improvement over binary search, dividing the array into three parts instead of two in each iteration.

### Algorithm Steps

1. Define the search space by initializing low and high pointers.
2. Divide the search space into three parts using two mid pointers: `mid1 = low + (high - low) / 3`
   and `mid2 = high - (high - low) / 3`.
3. Compare the target value with elements at mid1 and mid2.
4. If the target is equal to the element at mid1 or mid2, return the index.
5. If the target is less than the element at mid1, perform ternary search on the left part.
6. If the target is greater than the element at mid2, perform ternary search on the right part.
7. If the target is between the elements at mid1 and mid2, perform ternary search on the middle part.
8. Repeat the process until the target is found or the search space is empty.

### Time Complexity

- Best Case: O(1) (when the target is at mid1 or mid2)
- Average Case: O(log3 N)
- Worst Case: O(log3 N)

### Space Complexity

- O(1) (constant space for pointers and variables)

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- Efficient on uniformly distributed data.
- Performs better than binary search in certain scenarios.

#### Disadvantages

- Not suitable for all types of data distributions.
- Requires more comparisons compared to binary search.

### Use Cases

Ternary Search is suitable for scenarios where the data is uniformly distributed, and the target value is not located
near the ends of the array.

### Example

Consider an array: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]` and the target value is `7`.

1. Initial state: `low = 0`, `high = 7`.
2. First iteration: `mid1 = 2`, `mid2 = 5`. Compare target with elements at mid1 and mid2.
3. Continue iterations until the target is found or the search space is empty.

### Conclusion

Ternary Search is a variation of binary search that divides the search space into three parts. While it has its
advantages, its efficiency depends on the distribution of the data and the location of the target value within the
array.

# Jump Search Algorithm

### Overview

Jump Search is an algorithm used for searching an element in a sorted array. It works by dividing the array into blocks
and performing a linear search within the identified block that may contain the target element.

### Algorithm Steps

1. Define the block size `jump`.
2. Start with the first block and jump to the next block until the target element is greater than the last element of
   the current block or the end of the array is reached.
3. Perform a linear search within the current block.
4. If the target element is found, return its index.
5. If the target element is not found, repeat steps 2-4 until the entire array is searched.

### Time Complexity

- O(âˆšn) where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity

- O(1) (constant space for pointers and variables).

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- Suitable for large sorted datasets.
- Performs better than linear search.

#### Disadvantages

- Requires a sorted array.
- Not as efficient as binary search in some cases.

### Use Cases

Jump Search is useful for scenarios where the data is sorted, and the array is too large for linear search but not large
enough for binary search to be significantly more efficient.

### Example

Consider a sorted array: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]` and the target value is `7`.

1. Define the block size (e.g., `jump = 2`).
2. Jump to the next block until the target value is greater than the last element of the current block.
3. Perform a linear search within the current block.

### Conclusion

Jump Search combines the advantages of linear search and binary search, making it efficient for large sorted datasets.
However, its performance depends on the block size chosen and the distribution of data in the array.

# Exponential Search Algorithm

### Overview

Exponential Search is an algorithm designed to find the position of a specific element in a sorted array. It combines
binary search and linear search, making it efficient for large datasets.

### Algorithm Steps

1. Determine a range by exponentially increasing the index starting from 1 until the value at that index is greater than
   or equal to the target element.
2. Perform a binary search within the identified range.
3. If the target element is found, return its index.
4. If the target element is not found, repeat steps 1-3 until the entire array is searched.

### Time Complexity

- O(log n) where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity

- O(1) (constant space for pointers and variables).

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- Efficient for large datasets.
- Combines the strengths of binary search and linear search.

#### Disadvantages

- Requires a sorted array.
- May not perform as well as binary search in some cases.

### Use Cases

Exponential Search is suitable for scenarios where the data is sorted, and the array is too large for linear search but
not large enough for binary search to be significantly more efficient.

### Example

Consider a sorted array: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]` and the target value is `7`.

1. Exponentially increase the index (e.g., `index = 2`, `index = 4`, ...).
2. Perform a binary search within the identified range.

### Conclusion

Exponential Search combines the strengths of binary search and linear search, making it a practical choice for scenarios
where the dataset is large and sorted.
